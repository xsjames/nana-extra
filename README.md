## propgrid2

<img src="https://github.com/JamesBremner/nana-extra/blob/master/screenshots/propgrid2.png">

A simple property editing grid.

This uses only high level nana widgets.  It is simpler to use and many times simpler to modify since the implementation
uses no arcane nana implementation details.

For comparison, [propertygrid](https://github.com/besh81/nana-extra/wiki/propertygrid) is implemented using 1870 lines of code
( not counting comments ) whereas propgrid2 needs only 355 lines.  The features supported by the two grids are quite similar.

## [plot2d](https://github.com/besh81/nana-extra/wiki/plot2d)
#### Author: [JamesBremner](https://github.com/JamesBremner)

A 2D plotting widget for the nana library.

The plot contains one or more traces.

Each trace can be of one of three types:

- Plot: succesive y-values with line drawn between them.
- Scatter: succesive x,y-values with box around each point
- Realtime: a specified number of the most recent y-values

Any number of plot and scatter traces can be shown together,
only one realtime trace may be present in a plot.

## panel_scrolled
#### Author: [JamesBremner](https://github.com/JamesBremner)

Nana panel specialization to display small visible scrollable part of the panel

The scrolled panel is large and mostly hidden.  The widgets are placed on this panel.

The visible panel is small and transparent, allows user to see a small part of the scrolled panel.

The visible panel is surrounded by scroll bars which control what part of scrolled panel is seen.

The visible panel and scroll bars are constructed automatically, to the dimensions specifed in the scrolled panel constructor

## progress_ex
#### Author: [ErrorFlynn](https://github.com/ErrorFlynn)

`progress_ex` is a simple extension of the `nana::progress` class, adding text to the widget and a few color presets. It modifies none of the existing behavior of the base class, and is constructed and used in exactly the same way.
